What linear regression is used for: Regression is also useful when you want to forecast a response using a new set of predictors
How linear regression works
How to implement linear regression in Python, step by step

single linear regression 
y = a*x +b
y = target varaible
2= coefficent
m= dependent variable
b= interception 

multi linear regression 
y=m1* area+m2* breadroom +m3* age+m4

y=target var
area,bed room,age= independent var
m4= intercept
m1,m2,m3 = coefficients
